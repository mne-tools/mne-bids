Version 0.10 (2022-03-14)
-------------------------

This release brings experimental fNIRS suppot, improvements in coordinate frame
handling, and various enhancements regarding MRI fiducials.

üìù Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- We now have **experimental** support for fNIRS data (SNIRF format). This is
  still super fresh, and the respective BIDS enhancement proposal (BEP) has not
  yet been finalized & accepted into the standard. However, we're excitied to
  be able to do this first step towards fNIRS support!

- Numerous improvements have been added to enhance our support for various
  coordinate frames, including those that are not yet supported by MNE-BIDS.
  These changes are mostly relevant to iEEG users. Please see the detailed list
  of changes below.

- We have added support for storing and reading multiple anatomical landmarks
  ("fiducials") for the same participant. This makes it possible, for example,
  to store different sets of landmarks for each recording session.

- It's now possible to store Neuroscan (CNT) files with MNE-BIDS.

üöÄ Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add experimental support for fNIRS (SNIRF) files in :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`, by `Robert Luke`_ (:gh:`406`)

- Add support for CNT (Neuroscan) files in :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`924`)

- Add the ability to write multiple landmarks with :func:`mne_bids.write_anat` (e.g. to have separate landmarks for different sessions) via the new ``kind`` parameter, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`955`)

- Similarly, :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans` and :func:`mne_bids.update_anat_landmarks` gained a new ``kind`` parameter to specify which of multiple landmark sets to operate on, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ and `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`955`, :gh:`957`)

- Add support for iEEG data in the coordinate frame ``Pixels``; although MNE-Python does not recognize this coordinate frame and so it will be set to ``unknown`` in the montage, MNE-Python can still be used to analyze this kind of data, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`976`)

- Add an explanation in :ref:`ieeg-example` of why it is better to have intracranial data in individual rather than template coordinates, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`975`)

- :func:`mne_bids.update_anat_landmarks` can now directly work with fiducials saved from the MNE-Python coregistration GUI or :func:`mne.io.write_fiducials`, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`977`)

- All non-MNE-Python BIDS coordinate frames are now set to ``'unknown'`` on reading, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`979`)

- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` can now write to template coordinates by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`980`)

- Add :func:`mne_bids.template_to_head` to transform channel locations in BIDS standard template coordinate systems to ``head`` and also provides a ``trans``, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`983`)

üßê API and behavior changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :func:`mne_bids.update_anat_landmarks` will now by default raise an exception if the requested MRI landmarks do not already exist. Use the new ``on_missing`` parameter to control this behavior, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`957`)

- :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans` now raises a warning if ``datatype`` or ``suffix`` of the provided electrophysiological :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath` are not set. In the future, this will raise an exception, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_(:gh:`969`)

- Passing ``fs_subject=None`` to :func:`get_head_mri_trans` has been deprecated. Please pass the FreeSurfer subject name explicitly, by Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`977`)

- Corrupted or missing fiducials in ``head`` coordinates now raise an error instead of warning in :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`980`)

üõ† Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ü™≤ Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Forcing EDF conversion in :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` properly uses the ``overwrite`` parameter now, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`930`)

- :func:`mne_bids.make_report` now correctly handles ``participant.tsv`` files that only contain a ``participant_id`` column, by `Simon Kern`_ (:gh:`912`)

- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` doesn't store age, handedness, and sex in ``participants.tsv`` anymore for empty-room recordings, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`935`)

- When :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids` automatically creates new hierarchical event names based on event values (in cases where the same ``trial_type`` was assigned to different ``value``s in ``*_events.tsv``), ``'n/a'`` values will now be converted to ``'na'``, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`937`)

- Avoid ``DeprecationWarning`` in :func:`mne_bids.inspect_dataset` with the upcoming MNE-Python 1.0 release, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`942`)

- Avoid modifying the instance of :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath` if validation fails when calling :meth:`mne_bids.BIDSPath.update`, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`950`)

- :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans` now respects ``datatype`` and ``suffix`` of the provided electrophysiological :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath`, simplifying e.g. reading of derivaties, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`969`)

- Do not convert unknown coordinate frames to ``head``, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`976`)

.. _changes_0_8:

Version 0.8 (2021-07-15)
------------------------

This release brings numerous improvements and fixes based on feedback from our
users, including those working with very large datasets. MNE-BIDS now handles
previously-overlooked edge cases, offers a much more efficient way to
store data on macOS and Linux (using symbolic links), and lays the groundwork
for supporting BIDS derivatives, i.e., storing modified data.

Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can now write preloaded and potentially modified data with
  :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` by passing ``allow_preload=True``. This is
  a first step towards supporting derivative files.
- `mne_bids.BIDSPath` now has property getters and setters for all BIDS
  entities. What this means is that you can now do things like
  ``bids_path.subject = '01'`` instead of ``bids_path.update(subject='01')``.
- We now support Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) data.
- The way we handle anatomical landmarks was greatly revamped to ensure we're
  always using the correct coordinate systems. A new function,
  `mne_bids.get_anat_landmarks`, helps with extracting fiducial points from
  anatomical scans.
- When creating a BIDS dataset from FIFF files on macOS and Linux, MNE-BIDS
  can now optionally generate symbolic links to the original files instead of
  copies. Simply pass ``symlink=True`` to
  :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`. This can massively reduce the storage space
  requirements.

Detailed list of changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The fields "DigitizedLandmarks" and "DigitizedHeadPoints" in the json sidecar of Neuromag data are now set to ``true`` or ``false`` depending on whether any landmarks (NAS, RPA, LPA) or extra points are found in ``raw.info['dig']``, by `Eduard Ort`_ (:gh:`772`)
- Updated the "Read BIDS datasets" example to use data from `OpenNeuro <https://openneuro.org>`_, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`753`)
- :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans` is now more lenient when looking for the fiducial points (LPA, RPA, and nasion) in the MRI JSON sidecar file, and accepts a larger variety of landmark names (upper- and lowercase letters; ``'nasion'`` instead of only ``'NAS'``), by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`769`)
- :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans` gained a new keyword argument ``t1_bids_path``, allowing for the MR scan to be stored in a different session or even in a different BIDS dataset than the electrophysiological recording, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`771`)
- Add writing simultaneous EEG-iEEG recordings via :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`. The desired output datatype must be specified in the :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath` object, by `Richard K√∂hler`_ (:gh:`774`)
- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` gained a new keyword argument ``symlink``, which allows to create symbolic links to the original data files instead of copying them over. Currently works for ``FIFF`` files on macOS and Linux, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`778`)
- :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath` now has property getter and setter methods for all BIDS entities, i.e., you can now do things like ``bids_path.subject = 'foo'`` and don't have to resort to ``bids_path.update()``. This also ensures you'll get proper completion suggestions from your favorite Python IDE, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`786`)
- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now stores information about continuous head localization measurements (e.g., Elekta/Neuromag cHPI) in the MEG sidecar file, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`794`)
- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` gained a new parameter ``empty_room`` that allows to specify an associated empty-room recording when writing an MEG data file. This information will be stored in the ``AssociatedEmptyRoom`` field of the MEG JSON sidecar file, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`795`)
- Added support for the new channel type ``'dbs'`` (Deep Brain Stimulation), which was introduced in MNE-Python 0.23, by `Richard K√∂hler`_ (:gh:`800`)
- :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids` now warns in many situations when it encounters a mismatch between the channels in ``*_channels.tsv`` and the raw data, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`823`)
- MNE BIDS now accepts ``.mrk`` head digitization files used in the KIT/Yokogawa/Ricoh MEG system, by `Jean-R√©mi King`_ and `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`842`)

API and behavior changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Writing datasets via :func:`write_raw_bids`, will now never overwrite ``dataset_description.json`` file, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`765`)
- When writing BIDS datasets, MNE-BIDS now tags them as BIDS 1.6.0 (we previously tagged them as BIDS 1.4.0), by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`782`)
- :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids` now passes ``allow_maxshield=True`` to the MNE-Python reader function by default when reading FIFF files. Previously, ``extra_params=dict(allow_maxshield=True)`` had to be passed explicitly, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`787`)
- The ``raw_to_bids`` command has lost its ``--allow_maxshield`` parameter. If writing a FIFF file, we will now always assume that writing data before applying a Maxwell filter is fine, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`787`)
- :meth:`mne_bids.BIDSPath.find_empty_room` now first looks for an ``AssociatedEmptyRoom`` field in the MEG JSON sidecar file to retrieve the empty-room recording; only if this information is missing, it will proceed to try and find the best-matching empty-room recording based on measurement date (i.e., fall back to the previous behavior), by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`795`)
- If :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids` encounters raw data with the ``STI 014`` stimulus channel and this channel is not explicitly listed in ``*_channels.tsv``, it is now automatically removed upon reading, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`823`)
- :func:`mne_bids.get_anat_landmarks` was added to clarify and simplify the process of generating landmarks that now need to be passed to :func:`mne_bids.write_anat`; this deprecates the arguments ``raw``, ``trans`` and ``t1w`` of :func:`mne_bids.write_anat`, by `Alex Rockhill`_ and `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`827`)
- :func:`write_raw_bids` now accepts preloaded raws as input with some caveats if the new parameter ``allow_preload`` is explicitly set to ``True``. This enables some preliminary support for items such as uncommon file formats, generated data, and processed derivatives, by `Sin Kim`_ (:gh:`819`)
- MNE-BIDS now writes all TSV data files with a newline character at the end of the file, complying with UNIX/POSIX standards, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`831`)

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- For downloading `OpenNeuro <https://openneuro.org>`_ datasets, ``openneuro-py`` is now required to run the examples and build the documentation, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`753`)
- MNE-BIDS now depends on `setuptools <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io>`_. This package is normally installed by your Python distribution automatically, so we don't expect any users to be affected by this change, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`794`)
- MNE-BIDS now requires Python 3.7 or higher, because Python 3.6 is soon reaching its end of life.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- :func:`mne_bids.make_report` now (1) detects male/female sex and left/right handedness irrespective of letter case, (2) will parse a ``gender`` column if no ``sex`` column is found in ``participants.tsv``, and (3) reports sex as male/female instead of man/woman, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`755`)
- The :class:`mne.Annotations` ``BAD_ACQ_SKIP`` ‚Äì added by the acquisition system to ``FIFF`` files ‚Äì will now be preserved when reading raw data, even if these time periods are **not** explicitly included in ``*_events.tsv``, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ and `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`754` and :gh:`762`)
- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` will handle different cased extensions for EDF files, such as `.edf` and `.EDF` by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`765`)
- :func:`mne_bids.inspect_dataset` didn't handle certain filenames correctly on some systems, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`769`)
- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now works across data types with ``overwrite=True``, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`791`)
- :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids` didn't always replace all traces of the measurement date and time stored in the raw data with the date found in `*_scans.tsv`, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`812`, :gh:`815`)
- :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids` crashed when the (optional) ``acq_time`` column was missing in ``*_scans.tsv``, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`814`)
- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` doesn't crash anymore if the designated output directory contains the string ``"tsv"``, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`833`)
- :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans` gave incorrect results when the T1 image was not in LIA format, now all formats function properly, by `Alex Rockhill`_ and `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`827`)
- :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans` and :func:`mne_bids.write_anat` used a T1w image but depended specifically on the freesurfer T1w image. Now the FreeSurfer subjects directory is used, by `Alex Rockhill`_ and `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`827`)

.. _changes_0_7:

Version 0.7 (2021-03-22)
------------------------

This release brings numerous enhancements and bug fixes that enhance reading
and writing BIDS data, and improve compatibility with the latest BIDS
specifications.

Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Channel names in ``*_channels.tsv`` and ``*_electrodes.tsv`` files now always
  take precedence over the names stored in the raw files.
- When reading data where the same trial type refers to different trigger
  values, we will now automatically create hierarchical event names in the
  form of ``trial_type/value1``, `trial_type/value2`` etc.
- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now allows users to specify a format
  conversion via the new ``format`` parameter.
- Various improvements to data reading and :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath` make
  working with real-life data easier.
- Many bug fixes in :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` and in the MNE-BIDS

Detailed list of changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Some datasets out in the real world have a non-standard ``stim_type`` instead of a ``trial_type`` column in ``*_events.tsv``. :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids` now makes use of this column, and emits a warning, encouraging users to rename it, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`680`)
- When reading data where the same event name or trial type refers to different event or trigger values, we will now create a hierarchical event name in the form of ``trial_type/value``, e.g. ``stimulus/110``, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`688`)
- When reading data via :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids`, the channel names specified in the BIDS ``*_channels.tsv`` and ``*_electrodes.tsv`` files now always take precedence over (and do not need to match) the channel names stored in the raw files anymore, by `Adam Li`_ and `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`691`, :gh:`704`)
- Improve the ``Convert iEEG data to BIDS`` tutorial to include a note on how BIDS and MNE-Python coordinate frames are handled, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`717`)
- More detailed error messages when trying to write modified data via :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`719`)

- Data types that are currently unsupported by MNE-BIDS (e.g. ``dwi``, ``func``) can now be used in :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath` by setting ``check=False``, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`744`)
- Arbitrary file names can now be represented as a `BIDSPath`` by passing the entire name as ``suffix`` and setting ``check=False``, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`729`)
- Add support for MNE's flux excitation channel (``exci``), by `Maximilien Chaumon`_ (:gh:`728`)

- :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids` now stores the ``participant_id`` value from ``participants.tsv`` in ``raw.info['subject_info']['his_id']``, not in ``raw.info['subject_info']['participant_id']`` anymore, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`745`)

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fix writing MEGIN Triux files, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`674`)
- Anonymization of EDF files in :func:`write_raw_bids` will now convert recording date to ``01-01-1985 00:00:00`` if anonymization takes place, while setting the recording date in the ``scans.tsv`` file to the anonymized date, thus making the file EDF/EDFBrowser compliant, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`669`)
- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` will not overwrite an existing ``coordsystem.json`` anymore, unless explicitly requested, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`675`)

Version 0.6 üéÑ (2020-12-16)
---------------------------

These are challenging days for many of us, and to make your lives
ever so slightly easier, we've been working hard to deliver this early
Christmas present üéÅ And even if you do not celebrate Christmas, we are quite
certain you will like what we got for you! So ‚Äì what are you waiting for? It's
time to unwrap!

Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The new Inspector, which can be invoked via :func:`mne_bids.inspect_dataset`,
  allows you to interactively explore your raw data, change
  the bad channels selection, and edit :class:`mne.Annotations`. It also
  performs automated detection of flat data segments or channels, to assist
  you during visual inspection. The capabilities of the inspector will be
  further expanded in upcoming releases of MNE-BIDS.

- To further assist you during data inspection, we have added a function to
  summarize all events present in a dataset,
  :func:`mne_bids.stats.count_events`.

- Sidecar JSON files can now be updated using a template via
  :func:`mne_bids.update_sidecar_json`.

- You can now read and write FLASH MRI images using
  :func:`mne_bids.write_anat`. We also fixed some issues with MRI defacing
  along the way.

- Event durations are now preserved upon reading and writing data (we used to
  set all event durations to zero before).

API changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

- When passing event IDs to :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` via ``events_data`` without an accompanying event description in ``event_id``, we will now raise a `ValueError`. This ensures that accidentally un-described events won't get written unnoticed, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`603`)
- The :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans` now has a parameter ``extra_params`` to allow passing arguments specific to a file format, by `Mainak Jas`_ (:gh:`638`)

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Writing BrainVision data now requires ``pybv`` 0.4 or later.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Make sure large FIF files with splits are handled transparently on read and write, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`612`)

- Ensure sidecar files (`.tsv` and `.json`) are always read and written in UTF-8, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`625`)
- Fix a bug where ``participants.tsv`` was not being appended to correctly when it contained a subset of ``hand``, ``age`` and ``sex``, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`648`)
- :func:`mne_bids.copyfiles.copyfile_eeglab` didn't handle certain EEGLAB files correctly, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`653`)

.. _changes_0_5:

Version 0.5 (2020-10-22)
------------------------

This is a **big** release with lots of changes, many of them breaking existing
code. But do not fear: migration is easy, and you will **love** what we have
been cooking for you!


Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- We introduce `mne_bids.BIDSPath`, a new class for all BIDS file and folder
  operations. All functions in MNE-BIDS that previously accepted filenames
  and folder locations (e.g. ``bids_root``) have been updated to work with
  ``BIDSPath``. Others have been removed.
  Consequently, you will need to update your existing code, too.
  See the ``API changes`` section for an overview of which functions have
  changed or have been removed, and follow
  :ref:`this introduction<bidspath-intro>` and our
  to learn about the basics of ``BIDSPath``. Don't worry ‚Äì it's going to be a
  breeze! ü§ó

- MNE-BIDS now requires MNE-Python 0.21.

- The new function :func:`mne_bids.make_report` can help you populate a
  paragraph of your next paper's methods section!

- You can now interactively mark channels as bad using
  ``mne_bids.mark_bad_channels``.

- Elekta/Neuromag/MEGIN fine-calibration and crosstalk files can now be stored
  in your BIDS dataset via :func:`mne_bids.write_meg_calibration` and
  :func:`mne_bids.write_meg_crosstalk`.

- When writing a raw file that contains annotations, these will now be
  converted to and stored as events by :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`.
