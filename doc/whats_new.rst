Detailed list of changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

üöÄ Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You can now write raw data and an associated empty-room recording with just a single call to :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`: the ``empty_room`` parameter now also accepts an :class:`mne.io.Raw` data object. The empty-room session name will be derived from the recording date automatically, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`998`)

- :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now stores participant weight and height in ``participants.tsv``, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1031`)

- :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now supports EGI format, by `Anand Saini`_, `Scott Huberty`_ and `Mathieu Scheltienne`_ (:gh:`1006`)

- When a given subject cannot be found, valid suggestions are now printed, by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`1066`)

- TSV files that are empty (i.e., only a header row is present) are now handled more robustly and a warning is issued, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`1038`)

- :class:`~mne_bids.BIDSPath` now supports the BIDS "description" entity ``desc``, used in derivative data, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1049`)

- Added support for ``GSR`` (galvanic skin response / electrodermal activity, EDA) and ``TEMP`` (temperature) channel types, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1059`)

- Added support for reading EEG files in Curry 8 format ('.cdt' extension) by `Denis Engemann`_ (:gh:`1072`)

üßê API and behavior changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now expects all but the first four parameters to be passed as keyword arguments, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1054`)

- The ``events_data`` parameter of :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids` has been deprecated in favor of a new parameter named ``events``. This ensures more consistency between the MNE-BIDS and MNE-Python APIs. You may continue using the ``events_data`` parameter for now, but a ``FutureWarning`` will be raised. ``events_data`` will be removed in MNE-BIDS 0.14, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1054`)

- In many places, we used to infer the ``datatype`` of a :class:`~mne_bids.BIDSPath` from the ``suffix``, if not explicitly provided. However, this has lead to trouble in certain edge cases. In an effort to reduce the amount of implicit behavior in MNE-BIDS, we now require users to explicitly specify a ``datatype`` whenever the invoked functions or methods expect one, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1030`)

- :func:`mne_bids.make_dataset_description` now accepts keyword arguments only, and can now also write the following metadata: ``HEDVersion``, ``EthicsApprovals``, ``GeneratedBy``, and ``SourceDatasets``, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`406`)

- The deprecated function ``mne_bids.mark_bad_channels`` has been removed in favor of :func:`mne_bids.mark_channels`, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1009`)

- :func:`mne_bids.print_dir_tree` now raises a :py:class:`FileNotFoundError` instead of a :py:class:`ValueError` if the directory does not exist, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1013`)

- Passing only one of ``events`` and ``event_id`` to :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now raises a ``ValueError`` instead of a ``RuntimeError``, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1054`)

- Until now, :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath` prepends extensions with a period "." automatically. We intend to remove this undocumented side-effect and now emit a ``FutureWarning`` if an ``extension`` that does not start with a ``.`` is provided. Starting with MNE-BIDS 0.12, an exception will be raised in this case, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1061`)

- Provide a more helpful error message when trying to write non-preloaded concatenated data, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`#1075`)

üõ† Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- MNE-BIDS now requires MNE-Python 1.0 or newer.

- Writing BrainVision files now requires ``pybv`` version ``0.7.3``, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`1011`)

ü™≤ Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fix ACPC in ``surface RAS`` instead of ``scanner RAS`` in :ref:`ieeg-example` and add convenience functions :func:`mne_bids.convert_montage_to_ras` and :func:`mne_bids.convert_montage_to_mri` to help, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`990`)

- Suppress superfluous warnings about MaxShield in many functions when handling Elekta/Neuromag/MEGIN data, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1000`)

- The MNE-BIDS Inspector didn't work if ``mne-qt-browser`` was installed and used as the default plotting backend, as the Inspector currently only supports the Matplotlib backend, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1007`)

- :func:`~mne_bids.copyfiles.copyfile_brainvision` can now deal with ``.dat`` file extension, by `Dominik Welke`_ (:gh:`1008`)

- :func:`~mne_bids.print_dir_tree` now correctly expands ``~`` to the user's home directory, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1013`)

- :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now correctly excludes stim channels when writing to electrodes.tsv, by `Scott Huberty`_ (:gh:`1023`)

- :func:`~mne_bids.read_raw_bids` doesn't populate ``raw.info['subject_info']`` with invalid values anymore, preventing users from writing the data to disk again, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1031`)

- Writing EEGLAB files was sometimes broken when ``.set`` and ``.fdt`` pairs were supplied. This is now fixed in :func:`~mne_bids.copyfiles.copyfile_eeglab`, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`1039`)

- Writing and copying CTF files now works on Windows when files already exist (``overwrite=True``), by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`1035`)

- Instead of deleting files and raising cryptic errors, an intentional error message is now sent when calling :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids` with the source file identical to the destination file, unless ``format`` is specified, by `Adam Li`_ and `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`889`)

- Internal helper function to :func:`~mne_bids.read_raw_bids` would reject BrainVision data if ``_scans.tsv`` listed a ``.eeg`` file instead of ``.vhdr``, by `Teon Brooks`_ (:gh:`1034`)

- Whenever :func:`~mne_bids.read_raw_bids` encounters a channel type that currently doesn't translate into an appropriate MNE channel type, the channel type will now be set to ``'misc``. Previously, seemingly arbitrary channel types would be applied, e.g. ``'eeg'`` for GSR and temperature channels, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1052`)

- Fix the incorrect setting of the fields ``ContinuousHeadLocalization`` and ``HeadCoilFrequency`` for Neuromag MEG recordings, by `Eduard Ort`_ (:gh:`1067`)
