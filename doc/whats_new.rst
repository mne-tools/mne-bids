Version 0.10 (2022-03-14)
-------------------------

This release brings experimental fNIRS suppot, improvements in coordinate frame
handling, and various enhancements regarding MRI fiducials.

üìù Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- We now have **experimental** support for fNIRS data (SNIRF format). This is
  still super fresh, and the respective BIDS enhancement proposal (BEP) has not
  yet been finalized & accepted into the standard. However, we're excitied to
  be able to do this first step towards fNIRS support!

- Numerous improvements have been added to enhance our support for various
  coordinate frames, including those that are not yet supported by MNE-BIDS.
  These changes are mostly relevant to iEEG users. Please see the detailed list
  of changes below.

- We have added support for storing and reading multiple anatomical landmarks
  ("fiducials") for the same participant. This makes it possible, for example,
  to store different sets of landmarks for each recording session.

- It's now possible to store Neuroscan (CNT) files with MNE-BIDS.

Detailed list of changes

üöÄ Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add experimental support for fNIRS (SNIRF) files in :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`, by `Robert Luke`_ (:gh:`406`)

- Add support for CNT (Neuroscan) files in :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`924`)

- Add the ability to write multiple landmarks with :func:`mne_bids.write_anat` (e.g. to have separate landmarks for different sessions) via the new ``kind`` parameter, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`955`)

- Similarly, :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans` and :func:`mne_bids.update_anat_landmarks` gained a new ``kind`` parameter to specify which of multiple landmark sets to operate on, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ and `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`955`, :gh:`957`)

- Add support for iEEG data in the coordinate frame ``Pixels``; although MNE-Python does not recognize this coordinate frame and so it will be set to ``unknown`` in the montage, MNE-Python can still be used to analyze this kind of data, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`976`)

- Add an explanation in :ref:`ieeg-example` of why it is better to have intracranial data in individual rather than template coordinates, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`975`)

- :func:`mne_bids.update_anat_landmarks` can now directly work with fiducials saved from the MNE-Python coregistration GUI or :func:`mne.io.write_fiducials`, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`977`)

- All non-MNE-Python BIDS coordinate frames are now set to ``'unknown'`` on reading, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`979`)

- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` can now write to template coordinates by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`980`)

- Add :func:`mne_bids.template_to_head` to transform channel locations in BIDS standard template coordinate systems to ``head`` and also provides a ``trans``, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`983`)

üßê API and behavior changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :func:`mne_bids.update_anat_landmarks` will now by default raise an exception if the requested MRI landmarks do not already exist. Use the new ``on_missing`` parameter to control this behavior, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`957`)

- :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans` now raises a warning if ``datatype`` or ``suffix`` of the provided electrophysiological :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath` are not set. In the future, this will raise an exception, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_(:gh:`969`)

- Passing ``fs_subject=None`` to :func:`get_head_mri_trans` has been deprecated. Please pass the FreeSurfer subject name explicitly, by Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`977`)

- Corrupted or missing fiducials in ``head`` coordinates now raise an error instead of warning in :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`980`)

üõ† Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- MNE-BIDS now requires Jinja2 to work with MNE-Python 0.24.

ü™≤ Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Forcing EDF conversion in :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` properly uses the ``overwrite`` parameter now, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`930`)

- :func:`mne_bids.make_report` now correctly handles ``participant.tsv`` files that only contain a ``participant_id`` column, by `Simon Kern`_ (:gh:`912`)

- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` doesn't store age, handedness, and sex in ``participants.tsv`` anymore for empty-room recordings, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`935`)

- When :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids` automatically creates new hierarchical event names based on event values (in cases where the same ``trial_type`` was assigned to different ``value``s in ``*_events.tsv``), ``'n/a'`` values will now be converted to ``'na'``, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`937`)

- Avoid ``DeprecationWarning`` in :func:`mne_bids.inspect_dataset` with the upcoming MNE-Python 1.0 release, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`942`)

- Avoid modifying the instance of :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath` if validation fails when calling :meth:`mne_bids.BIDSPath.update`, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`950`)

- :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans` now respects ``datatype`` and ``suffix`` of the provided electrophysiological :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath`, simplifying e.g. reading of derivaties, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`969`)

- Do not convert unknown coordinate frames to ``head``, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`976`)
