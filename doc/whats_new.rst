Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- :func:`mne_bids.make_report` now (1) detects male/female sex and left/right handedness irrespective of letter case, (2) will parse a ``gender`` column if no ``sex`` column is found in ``participants.tsv``, and (3) reports sex as male/female instead of man/woman, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`755`)
- The :class:`mne.Annotations` ``BAD_ACQ_SKIP`` – added by the acquisition system to ``FIFF`` files – will now be preserved when reading raw data, even if these time periods are **not** explicitly included in ``*_events.tsv``, by `Richard Höchenberger`_ (:gh:`xxx`)
