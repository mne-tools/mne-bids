Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The function :func:`mne_bids.print_dir_tree` has a new parameter ``return_str`` which allows it to return a str of the dir tree instead of printing it, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (`#600 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids/pull/600>`_)
- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now preserves event durations when writing :class:`mne.Annotations` to ``*_events.tsv`` files, and :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids` restores these durations upon reading, by `Richard Höchenberger`_ (`#603 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids/pull/603>`_)
- Writing BrainVision data via :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` will now set the unit of EEG channels to µV for enhanced interoperability with other software, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_, `Stefan Appelhoff`_, and `Richard Höchenberger`_ (`#610 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids/pull/610>`_)
- The function :func:`mne_bids.print_dir_tree` has a new parameter ``return_str`` which allows it to return a str of the dir tree instead of printing it, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`600`)
- :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now preserves event durations when writing :class:`mne.Annotations` to ``*_events.tsv`` files, and :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids` restores these durations upon reading, by `Richard Höchenberger`_ (:gh:`603`)
- Writing BrainVision data via :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` will now set the unit of EEG channels to µV for enhanced interoperability with other software, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_, `Stefan Appelhoff`_, and `Richard Höchenberger`_ (:gh:`610`)
- New function :func:`mne_bids.stats.count_events` to easily summarize all the events present in a dataset, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`629`)
- Add :func:`mne_bids.update_sidecar_json` to allow updating sidecar JSON files with a template, by `Adam Li`_ and `Austin Hurst`_ (:gh:`601`)
- Add support for anonymizing EDF and BDF files without converting to BrainVision format, by `Austin Hurst`_ (:gh:`636`)
- Add support for writing FLASH MRI data with :func:`mne_bids.write_anat`, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`641`)
- Add interactive data inspector :func:`mne_bids.inspect_dataset`, by `Richard Höchenberger`_ (:gh:`561`)

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^
- Make sure large FIF files with splits are handled transparently on read and write, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`612`)
- The function :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now outputs ``*_electrodes.tsv`` and ``*_coordsystem.json`` files for EEG/iEEG data that are BIDS-compliant (only contain subject, session, acquisition, and space entities), by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`601`)
- Make sure writing empty-room data with anonymization shifts the session back in time, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`611`)
- Fix a bug in :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`, where passing raw data with :class:`mne.Annotations` set and the ``event_id`` dictionary not containing the :class:`mne.Annotations` descriptions as keys would raise an error, by `Richard Höchenberger`_ (:gh:`603`)
- Fix a bug in :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` when passing raw MEG data with Internal Active Shielding (IAS) from Triux system, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`616`)
- Fix a bug in :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`, where original format of data was not kept when writing to FIFF, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_, `Stefan Appelhoff`_, and `Richard Höchenberger`_ (:gh:`610`)
- Fix a bug where conversion to BrainVision format was done even when non-Volt channel types were present in the data (BrainVision conversion is done by ``pybv``, which currently only supports Volt channel types), by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`619`)
- Ensure sidecar files (`.tsv` and `.json`) are always read and written in UTF-8, by `Richard Höchenberger`_ (:gh:`625`)

API changes
^^^^^^^^^^^
- When passing event IDs to :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids` via ``events_data`` without an accompanying event description in ``event_id``, we will now raise a `ValueError`. This ensures that accidentally un-described events won't get written unnoticed, by `Richard Höchenberger`_ (:gh:`603`)
- The :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans` now has a parameter ``extra_params`` to allow passing arguments specific to a file format, by `Mainak Jas`_ (:gh:`638`)
- The first parameter of :func:`mne_bids.write_anat` is now called ``image`` and not ``t1w``, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`641`)

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Writing BrainVision data now requires ``pybv`` 0.4 or later.
