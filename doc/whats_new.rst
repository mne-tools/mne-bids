🚀 Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Speed up :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids` when lots of events are present by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`1079`)
- Add the option ``return_candidates`` to :meth:`mne_bids.BIDSPath.find_empty_room` by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`1083`)
- When writing data via :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids`, it is now possible to specify a custom mapping of :class:`mne.Annotations` descriptions to event codes via the ``event_id`` parameter. Previously, passing this parameter would always require to also pass ``events``, and using a custom event code mapping for annotations was impossible, by `Richard Höchenberger`_ (:gh:`1084`)

🪲 Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- When writing data containing :class:`mne.Annotations` **and** passing events to :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids`, previously, annotations whose description did not appear in ``event_id`` were silently dropped. We now raise an exception and request users to specify mappings between descriptions and event codes in this case. It is still possible to omit ``event_id`` if no ``events`` are passed, by `Richard Höchenberger`_ (:gh:`1084`)
