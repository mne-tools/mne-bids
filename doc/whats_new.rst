Detailed list of changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

üöÄ Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You can now write raw data and an associated empty-room recording with just a single call to :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`: the ``empty_room`` parameter now also accepts an :class:`mne.io.Raw` data object. The empty-room session name will be derived from the recording date automatically, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`998`)

- :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now stores participant weight and height in ``participants.tsv``, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1031`)

- :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now supports EGI format by `Anand Saini`_, `Scott Huberty`_ and `Mathieu Scheltienne`_ (:gh:`1006`)

üßê API and behavior changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- In many places, we used to infer the ``datatype`` of a :class:`~mne_bids.BIDSPath` from the ``suffix``, if not explicitly provided. However, this has lead to trouble in certain edge cases. In an effort to reduce the amount of implicit behavior in MNE-BIDS, we now require users to explicitly specify a ``datatype`` whenever the invoked functions or methods expect one, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1030`)

- :func:`mne_bids.make_dataset_description` now accepts keyword arguments only, and can now also write the following metadata: ``HEDVersion``, ``EthicsApprovals``, ``GeneratedBy``, and ``SourceDatasets``, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`406`)

- The deprecated function ``mne_bids.mark_bad_channels`` has been removed in favor of :func:`mne_bids.mark_channels`, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1009`)

- :func:`mne_bids.print_dir_tree` now raises a :py:class:`FileNotFoundError` instead of a :py:class:`ValueError` if the directory does not exist, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1013`)

üõ† Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Writing BrainVision files now requires ``pybv`` version ``0.7.3``, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`1011`)

ü™≤ Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fix ACPC in ``surface RAS`` instead of ``scanner RAS`` in :ref:`ieeg-example` and add convenience functions :func:`mne_bids.convert_montage_to_ras` and :func:`mne_bids.convert_montage_to_mri` to help, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`990`)

- Suppress superfluous warnings about MaxShield in many functions when handling Elekta/Neuromag/MEGIN data, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1000`)

- The MNE-BIDS Inspector didn't work if ``mne-qt-browser`` was installed and used as the default plotting backend, as the Inspector currently only supports the Matplotlib backend, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1007`)

- :func:`~mne_bids.copyfiles.copyfile_brainvision` can now deal with ``.dat`` file extension, by `Dominik Welke`_ (:gh:`1008`)

- :func:`~mne_bids.print_dir_tree` now correctly expands ``~`` to the user's home directory, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1013`)

- :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids` now correctly excludes stim channels when writing to electrodes.tsv, by `Scott Huberty`_ (:gh:`1023`)

- :func:`~mne_bids.read_raw_bids` doesn't populate ``raw.info['subject_info']`` with invalid values anymore, preventing users from writing the data to disk again, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1031`)

- Writing and copying CTF files now works on Windows when files already exist (``overwrite=True``), by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`1035`)
