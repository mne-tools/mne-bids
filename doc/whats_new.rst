Detailed list of changes

üöÄ Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- nothing yet

üßê API and behavior changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The experimental support for running MNE-BIDS examples from your browser using Binder has
  been removed, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`1202`)
- MNE-BIDS will no longer zero-pad ("zfill") entity indices passed to :class:`~mne_bids.BIDSPath`.
  For example, If ``run=1`` is passed to MNE-BIDS, it will no longer be silently auto-converted to ``run-01``, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`1215`)
- MNE-BIDS will no longer warn about missing leading punctuation marks for extensions passed :class:`~mne_bids.BIDSPath`.
  For example, MNE-BIDS will now silently auto-convert ``edf`` to ```.edf``, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (:gh:`1215`)

üõ† Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- MNE-BIDS now requires Python 3.9 or higher.
- MNE-BIDS now requires MNE-Python 1.5.0 or higher.
- ``edfio`` replaces ``EDFlib-Python`` for export to EDF with MNE-Python >= 1.7.0.
- Installing ``mne-bids[full]`` will now also install ``defusedxml`` on all platforms.
- Version requirements for optional dependency packages have been bumped up, see installation instructions.

ü™≤ Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The datatype in the dataframe returned by :func:`mne_bids.stats.count_events` is now
  ``pandas.Int64Dtype`` instead of ``float64``, by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`1227`)
- The :func:`mne_bids.copyfiles.copyfile_ctf` now accounts for files with ``.{integer}_meg4`` extension, instead of only .meg4,
  when renaming the files of a .ds folder, by `Mara Wolter`_ (:gh:`1230`)
- We fixed handling of time zones when reading ``*_scans.tsv`` files; specifically, non-UTC timestamps are now processed correctly,
  by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ and `Richard H√∂chenberger`_  (:gh:`1240`)

‚öïÔ∏è Code health
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The configuration of MNE-BIDS has been consolidated from several files (e.g., ``setup.cfg``,
  ``setup.py``, ``requirements.txt``) and is now specified in a standard ``pyproject.toml``
  file, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`1202`)
- Linting and code formatting is now done entirely using ``ruff``. Previously used tools
  (e.g., ``flake8``, ``black``) have been fully replaced, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`1203`)
- The package build backend has been switched from ``setuptools`` to ``hatchling``. This
  only affects users who build and install MNE-BIDS from source, and should not lead to
  changed runtime behavior, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1204`)
- Display of the version number on the website is now truncated for over-long version strings,
  by `Daniel McCloy`_ (:gh:`1206`)
- The long deprecated ``events_data`` parameter has been fully removed from
  :func:`~mne_bids.write_raw_bids` in favor of ``events``, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`1229`)
