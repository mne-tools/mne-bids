üõ† Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- MNE-BIDS now requires Python 3.9 or higher.
- MNE-BIDS now requires MNE-Python 1.5.0 or higher.
- ``edfio`` replaces ``EDFlib-Python`` for export to EDF with MNE-Python >= 1.7.0.

ü™≤ Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- nothing yet

‚öïÔ∏è Code health
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The configuration of MNE-BIDS has been consolidated from several files (e.g., ``setup.cfg``,
  ``setup.py``, ``requirements.txt``) and is now specified in a standard ``pyproject.toml``
  file, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`1202`)
- Linting and code formatting is now done entirely using ``ruff``. Previously used tools
  (e.g., ``flake8``, ``black``) have been fully replaced, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`1203`)
- The package build backend has been switched from ``setuptools`` to ``hatchling``. This
  only affects users who build and install MNE-BIDS from source, and should not lead to
  changed runtime behavior, by `Richard H√∂chenberger`_ (:gh:`1204`)
- Display of the version number on the website is now truncated for over-long version strings,
  by `Daniel McCloy`_ (:gh:`1206`)
