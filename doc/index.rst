MNE-BIDS
========

MNE-BIDS is a Python package that allows you to read and write
`BIDS <https://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_\ -compatible datasets with the help of
`MNE-Python <https://mne.tools/stable/index.html>`_.

Why?
----
MNE-BIDS links BIDS and MNE-Python with the goal to make your analyses faster
to code, more robust, and facilitate data and code sharing with co-workers
and collaborators.


What is this BIDS thing, anyway?
--------------------------------
BIDS, the Brain Imaging Data Structure, is a standard that describes how to
organize neuroimaging and electrophysiological data. In particular, it defines:

- which file formats to use
- how to name your files
- where to place your files within a directory structure
- what additional metadata to store

The complete set of rules is written down in the
`BIDS specification <https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/>`_.


Supported file formats
----------------------

Currently, we support all file formats that are in the BIDS specification for MEG, EEG, fNIRS, and iEEG data.
We also support a range of additional manufacturer formats to facilitate converting them to their BIDS-recommended
formats. For example, if you have a Nihon Kohden file, you can read that file using MNE-Python, and
then use MNE-BIDS convert it to the BrainVision format and store it according to BIDS.
