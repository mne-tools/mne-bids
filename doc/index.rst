MNE-BIDS
========

This is a library for converting existing files into BIDS compatible structure.

Installation
============

We recommend the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. To install ``mne_bids``, you first need to install its dependencies::

    $ pip install -U https://api.github.com/repos/mne-tools/mne-python/zipball/master

Then install mne_bids::

    $ pip install -U mne-bids

If you do not have admin privileges on the computer, use the ``--user`` flag
with `pip`. To upgrade, use the ``--upgrade`` flag provided by `pip`.

To check if everything worked fine, you can do::

    $ python -c 'import mne_bids'

and it should not give any error messages.

Quickstart
==========

Currently, we support writing of BIDS datasets for MEG and EEG. Support for
iEEG is experimental at the moment.

.. code:: python

    >>> from mne import io
    >>> from mne_bids import write_raw_bids
    >>> raw = io.read_raw_fif('my_old_file.fif')
    >>> write_raw_bids(raw, 'sub-01_ses-01_run-05', output_path='./bids_dataset')

Reading of BIDS data will also be supported in the next version.

Bug reports
===========
