Version 0.5 (2020-10-xx)
------------------------

This is a **big** release with lots of changes, many of them breaking existing
code. But do not fear: migration is easy, and you will **love** what we have
been cooking for you!

Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- We introduce `mne_bids.BIDSPath`, a new class for all BIDS file and folder
  operations. All functions in MNE-BIDS that previously accepted filenames
  and folder locations (e.g. ``bids_root``) have been updated to work with
  ``BIDSPath``. Others have been removed.
  Consequently, you will need to update your existing code, too.
  See the `API changes`_ section for an overview of which functions have
  changed or have been removed, and follow
  :ref:`this introduction<bidspath-intro>` and our 
  to learn about the basics of ``BIDSPath``. Don't worry â€“ it's going to be a
  breeze! ðŸ¤—

- MNE-BIDS now requires MNE-Python 0.21.

- The new function :func:`mne_bids.make_report` can help you populate a
  paragraph of your next paper's methods section!

- You can now interactively mark channels as bad using
  :func:`mne_bids.mark_bad_channels`.

- Elekta/Neuromag/MEGIN fine-calibration and crosstalk files can now be stored
  in your BIDS dataset via :func:`mne_bids.write_meg_calibration` and
  :func:`mne_bids.write_meg_crosstalk`.

- When writing a raw file that contains annotations, these will now be
  converted to and stored as events by :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`.

API changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

In the transition to using `mne_bids.BIDSPath`, the following functions have been updated:

- :func:`mne_bids.write_anat` now accepts a :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath` instead of entities as keyword arguments, by `Adam Li`_ (`#575 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids/pull/575>`_)
- In :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`, :func:`mne_bids.read_raw_bids`, and :func:`mne_bids.get_head_mri_trans`, the ``bids_basename`` and ``bids_root`` keyword arguments have been removed. The functions now expect ``bids_path``, an instance of :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath`, by `Adam Li`_ (`#525 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids/pull/525>`_)

The following functions have been removed:

- ``mne_bids.make_bids_basename`` has been removed. Use :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath` directly, by `Adam Li`_ (`#511 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids/pull/511>`_)

Further API changes:

- The functions :func:`mne_bids.write_anat`, :func:`mne_bids.make_report`, :func:`mne_bids.get_entity_vals` and :func:`mne_bids.get_datatypes` use now expect a ``root`` keyword argument instead of ``bids_root``, `Adam Li`_ (`#556 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids/pull/556>`_)
- Added namespace :code:`mne_bids.path` which hosts path-like functionality for MNE-BIDS, by `Adam Li`_ (`#483 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids/pull/483>`_)

- :func:`mne_bids.make_dataset_description` now accepts the argument ``overwrite``, which will reset all fields if ``True``.

- It is now required to specify the Power Line Frequency to use :func:`write_raw_bids`, while in 0.4 it could be estimated, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ and `Alex Rockhill`_ (`#506 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids/pull/506>`_)
