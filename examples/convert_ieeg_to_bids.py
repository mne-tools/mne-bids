08. Convert iEEG data to BIDS format
====================================

In this example, we use MNE-BIDS to create a BIDS-compatible directory of iEEG
data. Specifically, we will follow these steps:

1. Download some iEEG data.

2. Load the data, extract information, and save in a new BIDS directory.

3. Check the result and compare it with the standard.

4. Cite MNE-BIDS.

5. Repeat the process for the ``fsaverage`` template coordinate space.

The iEEG data will be written by :func:`write_raw_bids` with
the addition of extra metadata elements in the following files:

- the sidecar file ``ieeg.json``
- ``electrodes.tsv``
- ``coordsystem.json``
- ``events.tsv``
- ``channels.tsv``

Compared to EEG data, the main differences are within the
``coordsystem.json`` and ``electrodes.tsv`` files.
For more information on these files,
refer to the `iEEG part of the BIDS specification`_.

# %%
# Step 1: Download the data
# -------------------------
#
# First, we need some data to work with. We will use the
# data downloaded via MNE-Python's ``datasets`` API:
# :func:`mne.datasets.misc.data_path`
misc_path = mne.datasets.misc.data_path()

# The electrode coords data are in the tsv file format
# which is easily read in using numpy
raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(op.join(
    misc_path, 'seeg', 'sample_seeg_ieeg.fif'))
raw.info['line_freq'] = 60  # specify power line frequency as required by BIDS
subjects_dir = op.join(misc_path, 'seeg')  # Freesurfer recon-all directory

# %%
# When the locations of the channels in this dataset were found
# in `Locating Intracranial Electrode Contacts
# <https://mne.tools/dev/auto_tutorials/clinical/10_ieeg_localize.html>`_,
# the T1 was aligned to ACPC. So, this montage is in an
# `ACPC-aligned coordinate system
# <https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/CoordinateSystems>`_.
# We can either save the channel positions in the subject's anatomical
# space (from their T1 image) or we can transform to a template space
# such as ``fsaverage``. To save them in the individual space, it is
# required that the T1 have been aligned to ACPC and then the channel positions
# be in terms of that coordinate system. Automated alignment to ACPC has not
# been implemented in MNE yet, so if the channel positions are not in
# an ACPC-aligned coordinate system, using a template (like ``fsaverage``)
# is the best option.

# estimate the transformation from "head" to "mri" space
trans = mne.coreg.estimate_head_mri_t('sample_seeg', subjects_dir)

# %%
# Now let's convert the montage to "mri"
montage = raw.get_montage()
montage.apply_trans(trans)  # head->mri

# %%
# BIDS vs MNE-Python Coordinate Systems
# -------------------------------------
#
# BIDS has many acceptable coordinate systems for iEEG, which can be viewed in
# `appendix VIII`_ of the BIDS specification.
# However, MNE-BIDS depends on MNE-Python and MNE-Python does not support all
# these coordinate systems (yet).
#
# MNE-Python has a few tutorials on this topic:
#
# - `background on FreeSurfer`_
# - `MNE-Python coordinate frames`_
#
# MNE-Python supports using ``mni_tal`` and ``mri`` coordinate frames,
# corresponding to the ``fsaverage`` and ``ACPC`` (for an ACPC-aligned T1) BIDS
# coordinate systems respectively. All other coordinate coordinate frames in
# MNE-Python, if written with :func:`mne_bids.write_raw_bids`, must have
# an :attr:`mne_bids.BIDSPath.space` specified, and will be read in with
# the montage channel locations set to the coordinate frame 'unknown'.
#
# Step 2: Formatting as BIDS
# --------------------------
#
# Now, let us format the `Raw` object into BIDS.
#
# With this step, we have everything to start a new BIDS directory using
# our data. To do that, we can use :func:`write_raw_bids`
# Generally, :func:`write_raw_bids` tries to extract as much
# meta data as possible from the raw data and then formats it in a BIDS
# compatible way. :func:`write_raw_bids` takes a bunch of inputs, most of
# which are however optional. The required inputs are:
#
# - :code:`raw`
# - :code:`bids_basename`
# - :code:`bids_root`
#
# ... as you can see in the docstring:
print(write_raw_bids.__doc__)

# %%
# Let us initialize some of the necessary data for the subject.

# There is a subject, and specific task for the dataset.
subject_id = '1'
task = 'motor'

# get MNE-Python directory w/ example data
mne_data_dir = mne.get_config('MNE_DATASETS_MISC_PATH')

# There is the root directory for where we will write our data.
bids_root = op.join(mne_data_dir, 'ieeg_bids')

# %%
# To ensure the output path doesn't contain any leftover files from previous
# tests and example runs, we simply delete it.
#
# .. warning:: Do not delete directories that may contain important data!
#

if op.exists(bids_root):
    shutil.rmtree(bids_root)

# %%
# Now we just need make a :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath` to save the data.
#
# .. warning:: By passing ``acpc_aligned=True``, we are affirming that
#              the T1 in this dataset is aligned to ACPC. This is very
#              difficult to check with a computer which is why this

# Now it's time to manually check the BIDS directory and the meta files to add
# all the information that MNE-BIDS could not infer. For instance, you must
# describe ``iEEGReference`` and ``iEEGGround`` yourself.

# get the monage, apply the trans and make sure it's the same
# note: the head coordinates may differ because they are defined by

# %%
# Step 5: Store coordinates in a template space
# ---------------------------------------------
# Alternatively, if your T1 is not aligned to ACPC-space or you prefer to
# store the coordinates in a template space (e.g. ``fsaverage``) for another
# reason, you can also do that.
#
# Here we'll use the MNI Talairach transform to get to ``fsaverage`` space
# from "mri" aka surface RAS space.
# ``fsaverage`` is very useful for group analysis as shown in
# :ref:`tut-working-with-seeg`. Note, this is only a linear transform and so
# one loses quite a bit of accuracy relative to the needs of intracranial
# researchers so it is quite suboptimal. A better option is to use a
# symmetric diffeomorphic transform to create a one-to-one mapping of brain
# voxels from the individual's brain to the template as shown in
# :ref:`tut-ieeg-localize`. Even so, it's better to provide the coordinates
# in the individual's brain space, as was done above, so that the researcher
# who uses the coordinates has the ability to tranform them to a template
# of their choice.

# ensure the output path doesn't contain any leftover files from previous
# tests and example runs

# %%
# As you can see the coordinates stored in the ``raw`` object are slightly off.
# This is because the ``head`` coordinate frame is defined by the fiducials
# (nasion, left and right pre-auricular points), and, in the first case,
# the fiducials were found on the individual anatomy and then transformed
# to MNI space, whereas, in the second case, they were found directly on
# the template brain (this was done once for the template so that we could
# just load it from a file). This difference means that there are slightly
# different head->mri transforms. Once these transforms are applied, however,
# the positions are the same in MNI coordinates which is what is important.
#
# As a final step, let's go over how to assign the fiducials for a template
# brain where they are not found for you. Many template coordinate systems
# are allowed by BIDS but are not used in MNE-Python.
#
# .. note::
#     As of this writing, BIDS accepts channel coordinates in reference to the
#     the following template spaces: ``ICBM452AirSpace``,
#     ``ICBM452Warp5Space``, ``IXI549Space``, ``fsaverage``, ``fsaverageSym``,
#     ``fsLR``, ``MNIColin27``, ``MNI152Lin``,
#     ``MNI152NLin2009[a-c][Sym|Asym]``, ``MNI152NLin6Sym``,

#     ``OASIS30Atropos``, ``Talairach`` and ``UNCInfant``. As discussed above,
#     it is recommended to share the coordinates in the individual subject's
#     anatomical reference frame so that researchers who use the data can
#     transform the coordinates to any of these templates that they choose.

# In summary, as we saw, these standard template spaces that are allowable by
# BIDS are quite complicated. We therefore only cover these cases because
# datasets are allowed to be in these coordinate systems, and we want to be
# able to analyze them with MNE-Python. The template coordinate spaces
# don't specify a coordinate frame, so it is better to save the raw data in
# the individual's ACPC space, allowing the person analyzing the data to
# transform the positions to whatever template they want. Thus, we recommend
# if at all possible, saving BIDS iEEG data in ACPC coordinate space
# corresponding to the individual subject's brain, not in a template
# coordinate frame.
