  abstract = "The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques
              has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of
              thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and
              diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive
              study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used
              to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no
              widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data
              collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and
              reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible
              and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic
              pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem,
              we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a
              standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS
              standard uses file formats compatible with existing software,
              unifies the majority of practices already common in the field,
              and captures the metadata necessary for most common data
              processing operations.",

              the weak electromagnetic signals generated by neuronal activity
              in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate
              neural activation in the brain is a challenge that requires
              expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics, and
              numerical methods. As part of the MNE software suite, MNE-Python
              is an open-source software package that addresses this challenge
              by providing state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python
              that cover multiple methods of data preprocessing,
              source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of
              functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All
              algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent
              manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create
              M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts.
              Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python
              libraries for scientific comptutation (NumPy, SciPy) and
              visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater
              neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The
              code is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse,
              even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has only been
              under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly
              evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical
              tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code
              development to help share best practices. MNE-Python also gives
              easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users to get
              started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of methods
              by other researchers. Full documentation, including dozens of
              examples, is available at http://martinos.org/mne.",

              Structure (BIDS) to support the specific aspects of
              magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. MEG measures brain activity
              with millisecond temporal resolution and unique source imaging
              capabilities. So far, BIDS was a solution to organise magnetic
              resonance imaging (MRI) data. The nature and acquisition
              parameters of MRI and MEG data are strongly dissimilar. Although
              there is no standard data format for MEG, we propose MEG-BIDS as
              a principled solution to store, organise, process and share the
              multidimensional data volumes produced by the datatype. The
              standard also includes well-defined metadata, to facilitate
              future data harmonisation and sharing efforts. This responds to
              unmet needs from the multimodal neuroimaging community and paves
              the way to further integration of other techniques in
              electrophysiology. MEG-BIDS builds on MRI-BIDS, extending BIDS to
              a multimodal data structure. We feature several data-analytics
              software that have adopted MEG-BIDS, and a diverse sample of open

              magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG)
              data, such educational materials are usually restricted to the
              analysis of a single subject. This is in part because data from
              larger group studies are harder to share, but also analyses of
              such data often require subject-specific decisions which are hard
