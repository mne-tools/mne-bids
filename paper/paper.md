# Summary

With the emergence of the Brain Imaging Data Structure
(``BIDS``; [@Gorgolewski2016]) in 2016, the neuroscientific community received
a standard to organize and share data. Originally limited to MRI data formats,
BIDS is continuously being extended and by now also supports other neuroimaging
modalities such as MEG [@Niso2018], EEG [@Pernet2019], and iEEG [@Holdgraf2019].

BIDS prescribes how complex experiment data should be structured and which
metadata should be present next to the raw data. This set of guidelines
allows users to reap several benefits, such as:

1. **sharing data within a lab and between labs:** Through reading the BIDS
   specification, users are empowered to understand any BIDS dataset
   without requiring specialist knowledge.
1. **data validation:** Dedicated software can check whether the rules of
   BIDS are being followed in a dataset, and alert users to missing or broken
   data (see
   [bids-validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator)).
1. **automatic data handling and analysis pipelines:** With a perfect
   knowledge about which data to expect and where to search for it, many
   common workflows in data handling and analysis can be simplified or
   automated through specialized software.

To make use of these benefits, datasets must first be converted to
BIDS format. Furthermore, already existing data analysis software must be
extended to be aware of a BIDS format and how to properly use it.

This is where ``MNE-BIDS`` steps in. Harnessing BIDS and the data analysis
software MNE-Python [@Agramfort2013], it is the goal of ``MNE-BIDS`` to
automatically organize raw MEG, EEG, and iEEG datasets into the BIDS format and
to facilitate their analysis.

For example, starting with a single directory full of data files with arbitrary
names, ``MNE-BIDS`` can be used to extract existing metadata, reorganize the
files into the BIDS format, and write additional metadata. Moreover,
``MNE-BIDS`` supports converting raw data formats that are not BIDS
compatible into permissible formats. As a result, users can easily convert
their datasets to BIDS in a matter of minutes, rather than hours of manual
labour. All conversions performed by MNE-BIDS are validated with the
[bids-validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator) to ensure
compatibility with the BIDS format.

In addition to this core functionality, ``MNE-BIDS`` is continuously being
extended to facilitate the analysis of BIDS formatted data.
To name some features, it is possible to read a raw BIDS dataset and obtain a
Python object, ready for analyis with MNE-Python.
Users can save a T1-weighted anatomical MRI image alongside the MEG or EEG data
and apply an automatic defacing algorithm for anonymization purposes.
As a last example, fiducial points can be saved to store coregistration
information between the electrophysiology and MRI data, which allows for
automatic computation of forward and inverse solutions.

Users can easily install ``MNE-BIDS`` on all platforms via `pip` and `conda`,
and its functionality is continuously tested on Windows and Linux.
Other than three core dependencies for scientific computing
(`numpy`, `scipy`) and handling of MEG, EEG, and iEEG data (`mne`),
``MNE-BIDS`` has minimal dependencies, all of which are optional. The API of
the package is stable and extensively documented and explained in examples
(https://mne.tools/mne-bids/).

As of writing, ``MNE-BIDS`` has received code contributions from 15
contributors and its user base is steadily growing. Code development is
active and users are typically receiving support within a few hours of opening
an issue on our dedicated issue tracker.

MNE-BIDS is used in automated analysis pipelines such as the
MNE-study-template (https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-study-template)
[@Mainak2018] several large institutions such as
Martinos and "insert Matt's institution" have started to use MNE-BIDS.

The developer team is excited to improve the state of the art in data handling
and looking forward to welcoming new contributors and users.
