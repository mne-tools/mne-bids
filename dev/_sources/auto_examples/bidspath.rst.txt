===============================
10. An introduction to BIDSPath
===============================

BIDSPath is MNE-BIDS's working horse when it comes to file and folder
operations. Learn here how to use it.


.. code-block:: default

Obviously, to start exploring BIDSPath, we first need to import it.


.. code-block:: default


    from mne_bids import BIDSPath








Now let's discuss a little bit of background on the BIDS file and folder
naming scheme. The first term we are going to introduce is the **BIDS root**.
The BIDS root is simply the root folder of your BIDS dataset. For
example, if the BIDS data of one of your studies is stored in
`/Users/me/Studies/Study_01`, then this will be the BIDS root.

Similarly, if you have **no** BIDS dataset to begin with, you need to
consider where to store your data upon BIDS conversion. Again, the intended
target folder will be the BIDS root of your data.

Let's just pick an arbitrary BIDS root, for the purpose of this
demonstration.


.. code-block:: default


    bids_root = './my_bids_root'








This refers to a folder named `my_bids_root` in the current working
directory. Finally, let is create a ``BIDSPath``, and tell it about our
BIDS root. We can then also query the ``BIDSPath`` for its root.


.. code-block:: default


    bids_path = BIDSPath(root=bids_root)
    print(bids_path.root)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    my_bids_root




Great! But not really useful so far. BIDS also asks us to specify **subject
identifiers**. We can either create a new ``BIDSPath``, or update our
existing one. The value can be retrieved via the ``.subject`` attribute.


.. code-block:: default


    subject = '123'

    # Option 1: Create an entirely new BIDSPath.
    bids_path_new = BIDSPath(subject=subject, root=bids_root)
    print(bids_path_new.subject)

    # Option 2: Update the existing BIDSPath in-place.
    bids_path.update(subject=subject)
    print(bids_path.subject)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    123
    123




In this example, we are going to update the existing ``BIDSPath`` using its
``update()`` method. But note that all parameters we pass to this method can
also be used when creating a ``BIDSPath``.

Many studies consist of multiple **sessions**. As you may have guessed,
BIDS specifies how to store data for each session, and consequently,
``BIDSPath`` handles this for you too! Let's update our ``BIDSPath`` with
information on our experimental session, and try to retrieve it again via
``.session``.


.. code-block:: default


    session = 'test'
    bids_path.update(session=session)
    print(bids_path.session)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    test




Now that was easy! We're almost there! We also need to specify a
**data type**, i.e., ``meg`` for MEG data, ``eeg`` and ``ieeg`` for EEG and
iEEG data, or ``anat`` for anatomical MRI scans. Typically, MNE-BIDS will
infer the data type of your data automatically, for example when writing data
using `mne_bids.write_raw_bids`. For the sake of this example, however, we
are going to specify the data type explicitly.


.. code-block:: default


    datatype = 'meg'
    bids_path.update(datatype=datatype)
    print(bids_path.datatype)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    meg




Excellent! Let's have a look at the path we have constructed!


.. code-block:: default

    print(bids_path)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    /home/circleci/project/mne_bids/path.py:455: RuntimeWarning: Could not locate a data file of a supported format. This is likely a problem with your BIDS dataset. Please run the BIDS validator on your data. (root=my_bids_root, basename=sub-123_ses-test). []
      warn(msg)
    my_bids_root/sub-123/ses-test/meg/sub-123_ses-test




As you can see, ``BIDSPath`` automatically arranged all the information we
provided such that it creates a valid BIDS folder structure. You can also
retrieve a `pathlib.Path` object of this path:


.. code-block:: default


    pathlib_path = bids_path.fpath
    pathlib_path





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    /home/circleci/project/mne_bids/path.py:455: RuntimeWarning: Could not locate a data file of a supported format. This is likely a problem with your BIDS dataset. Please run the BIDS validator on your data. (root=my_bids_root, basename=sub-123_ses-test). []
      warn(msg)

    PosixPath('my_bids_root/sub-123/ses-test/meg/sub-123_ses-test')



Let's have a closer look at the components of our ``BIDSPath`` again.


.. code-block:: default


    bids_path





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    BIDSPath(
    root: my_bids_root
    datatype: meg
    basename: sub-123_ses-test)



The most interesting thing here is probably the **basename**. It's what
MNE-BIDS uses to name individual files. The basename consists of a set of
so-called **entities**, which are concatenated using underscores. You can
access it directly:


.. code-block:: default


    bids_path.basename





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    'sub-123_ses-test'



The two entities you can see here are the ``subject`` entity (``sub``) and
the ``session`` entity (``ses``). Each entity name also has a value; for
``sub``, this is ``123``, and for ``ses``, it is ``test`` in our example.
Entity names (or "keys") and values are separated via hyphens.
BIDS knows a much larger number of entities, and MNE-BIDS allows you to make
use of them. To get a list of all supported entities, use:


.. code-block:: default


    bids_path.entities





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    OrderedDict([('subject', '123'), ('session', 'test'), ('task', None), ('acquisition', None), ('run', None), ('processing', None), ('space', None), ('recording', None), ('split', None)])



As you can see, most entity keys are set to ``None``, which is the default
and implies that no value has been set. Let us add a ``run`` entity, and
remove the ``session``:


.. code-block:: default


    run = '01'
    session = None
    bids_path.update(run=run, session=session)
    bids_path





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    BIDSPath(
    root: my_bids_root
    datatype: meg
    basename: sub-123_run-01)



As you can see, the ``basename`` has been updated. In fact, the entire
**path** has been updated, and the ``ses-test`` folder has been dropped from
the path:


.. code-block:: default


    print(bids_path.fpath)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    /home/circleci/project/mne_bids/path.py:455: RuntimeWarning: Could not locate a data file of a supported format. This is likely a problem with your BIDS dataset. Please run the BIDS validator on your data. (root=my_bids_root, basename=sub-123_run-01). []
      warn(msg)
    my_bids_root/sub-123/meg/sub-123_run-01




Awesome! We're almost done! Two important things are still missing, though:
the so-called **suffix** and the filename **extension**. Sometimes these
terms are used interchangably, but in BIDS, they have a very specific
and different meaning!

The **suffix** is the last part of a BIDS filename before the extension. It
is the same as the datatype for MEG, EEG, and iEEG recordings (i.e.
``meg``, ``eeg``, and ``ieeg``, respectively) and ``T1w`` for T1-weighted
MRI scans. But the suffix is also used to create the names of sidecar files
like ``*_events.tsv``.

Which brings us directly to the **extension**: the very last part of a
filename. In MNE-BIDS, the extension contains a leading period, e.g.
``.tsv``.
Let's put our new knowledge to use!


.. code-block:: default


    bids_path.update(suffix='meg', extension='fif')
    print(bids_path.fpath)
    bids_path





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    my_bids_root/sub-123/meg/sub-123_run-01_meg.fif

    BIDSPath(
    root: my_bids_root
    datatype: meg
    basename: sub-123_run-01_meg.fif)



By default, most MNE-BIDS functions will try to infer to correct
suffix and extension for your data, and you don't need to specify them
manually.
