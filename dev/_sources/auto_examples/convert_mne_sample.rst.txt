02. Convert MNE sample data to BIDS format
==========================================

In this example we will use MNE-BIDS to organize the MNE sample data according
to the BIDS standard.
In a second step we will read the organized dataset using MNE-BIDS.

First we import some basic Python libraries, followed by MNE-Python and its
sample data, and then finally the MNE-BIDS functions we need for this example


.. code-block:: default


    import os.path as op

    import mne
    from mne.datasets import sample

    from mne_bids import (write_raw_bids, read_raw_bids, write_meg_calibration,
                          write_meg_crosstalk, BIDSPath, print_dir_tree)








Now we can read the MNE sample data. We define an `event_id` based on our
knowledge of the data, to give meaning to events in the data.

With `raw_fname` and `events_data`, we determine where to get the sample data
from. `output_path` determines where we will write the BIDS conversion to.


.. code-block:: default


    data_path = sample.data_path()
    event_id = {'Auditory/Left': 1, 'Auditory/Right': 2, 'Visual/Left': 3,
                'Visual/Right': 4, 'Smiley': 5, 'Button': 32}

    raw_fname = op.join(data_path, 'MEG', 'sample', 'sample_audvis_raw.fif')
    events_data = op.join(data_path, 'MEG', 'sample', 'sample_audvis_raw-eve.fif')
    output_path = op.join(data_path, '..', 'MNE-sample-data-bids')

.. note::

  ``mne-bids`` will try to infer as much information from the data as
  possible to then save this data in BIDS-specific "sidecar" files. For
  example the manufacturer information, which is inferred from the data file
  extension. However, sometimes inferring is ambiguous (e.g., if your file
  format is non-standard for the manufacturer). In these cases, MNE-BIDS does
  *not* guess and you will have to update your BIDS fields manually.

Based on our path definitions above, we read the raw data file, define
a new BIDS name for it, and then run the automatic BIDS conversion.

The sample MEG dataset comes with fine-calibration and crosstalk files that
are required when processing Elekta/Neuromag/MEGIN data using MaxFilter®.
Let's store these data in appropriate places, too.


.. code-block:: default


    cal_fname = op.join(data_path, 'SSS', 'sss_cal_mgh.dat')
    ct_fname = op.join(data_path, 'SSS', 'ct_sparse_mgh.fif')

    write_meg_calibration(cal_fname, bids_path)
    write_meg_crosstalk(ct_fname, bids_path)

Now let's see the structure of the BIDS folder we created.

A big advantage of having data organized according to BIDS is that software
packages can automate your workflow. For example, reading the data back
into MNE-Python can easily be done using :func:`read_raw_bids`.


.. code-block:: default


    raw = read_raw_bids(bids_path=bids_path)

The resulting data is already in a convenient form to create epochs and
evoked data.

    epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id)

The README created by :func:`write_raw_bids` also takes care of the citation
for mne-bids. If you are preparing a manuscript, please make sure to also
cite MNE-BIDS there.
