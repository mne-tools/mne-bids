==========================================
02. Convert MNE sample data to BIDS format
==========================================

In this example we will use MNE-BIDS to organize the MNE sample data according
to the BIDS standard.
In a second step we will read the organized dataset using MNE-BIDS.

First we import some basic Python libraries, followed by MNE-Python and its
sample data, and then finally the MNE-BIDS functions we need for this example

    from mne_bids import (write_raw_bids, read_raw_bids, write_meg_calibration,

    from mne_bids.stats import count_events

Now we can read the MNE sample data. We define an `event_id` based on our
knowledge of the data, to give meaning to events in the data.

With `raw_fname` and `events_data`, we determine where to get the sample data
from. `output_path` determines where we will write the BIDS conversion to.

  ``mne-bids`` will try to infer as much information from the data as
  possible to then save this data in BIDS-specific "sidecar" files. For
  example the manufacturer information, which is inferred from the data file
  extension. However, sometimes inferring is ambiguous (e.g., if your file
  format is non-standard for the manufacturer). In these cases, MNE-BIDS does
  *not* guess and you will have to update your BIDS fields manually.

Based on our path definitions above, we read the raw data file, define
a new BIDS name for it, and then run the automatic BIDS conversion.
